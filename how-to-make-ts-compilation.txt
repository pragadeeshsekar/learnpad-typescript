Use of tsconfig.json 
*********************

1. indicates the TypeScript Project root directory.
2. It has root files & compiler options 
      i) If files & include left unspecified - all files with .ts .d.ts .tsx extension are included ( if 'allowJs == true' then include '.js .jsx' extensions)
     ii) typeRoots - if mentioned only that packages will be included for compilation else all @types will be visible.
            eg: for including all packages under typings packages (this will ignore ./node_modules/@types packages)
                  {
                    "compilerOptions" : {
                          "typeRoots" : ["./typings"]
                    }
                  }
    iii) types : only listed elements will be used for compilation
            eg: to include node, express  ( ./node_modules/@types/node, ./node_modules/@types/express packages will be included, Other packages
             ./node_modules/@types/* will not be included)
             
                  {
                    "compilerOptions" : {
                          "types" : ["node", "express"]
                    }
                  }
